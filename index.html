      <p> A washing machine is a device used to thoroughly clean your clothes with detergent and water by cycling
        clothes for a period of time. A washing machine is typically paired with a dryer. For this project, I am
        specifically using the shared laundry machine in my apartment complex. This particular washing machine has an
        opening on the top that allows you to insert your clothes by pulling up a handle. To control the machine, the
        washer has three knobs. One where you select the size of the load, one to select the temperature of the water,
        and finally one to select how long you want the washer to run for. To start the machine you press the knob that
        controls the time. To stop the machine, either wait for the time to run out or open the lid.

    <h2>The Investigation</h2>

      <h3>To get a better understanding of how people interact with our washing machine, we will now observe users and
        conduct interviews afterwards. There answers are summarized below!</h3>

      <div class="boxes">
        <h4>Observations
          <ul>
            <li>Users very frequently turn the knobs too far, and they have to spin them around again</li>
            <li>Users open the lid and put in clothes quickly with ease</li>
            <li>Users never know how long the laundry machine will run for</li>
            <li>Users seem to have neutral to negative demeanors when using the machine</li>
          </ul>
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="boxes">
        <h4>“What was your initial reaction to the load size and the temperature knobs?”
          <ul>
            <li>Users seemed to not think much about these knobs. The temperature knob clearly was to determine the
              temperature of the water, however users did not know exactly what the load size knob would do, but this
              did not bother them.</li>
          </ul>
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="boxes">
        <h4>“What was your initial reaction to the control knob on the right?”
          <ul>
            <li>This knob greatly confused users. The knob has numbers that all users collectively agreed they thought
              would represent the length of the wash. However, this was never the case and the machine would run much
              longer. Some users speculated that the number could interact with the load size knob. </li>
          </ul>

      <div class="boxes">
        <h4>“Can you describe any difficulties, if any, you faced while using the washing machine?”
          <ul>
            <li>Small difficulties users faced were over-turning the knobs, but this was an easy mistake to fix. One
              user forgot to use detergent. The difficulty that every user reported was not knowing how to use the knob
              on the right. </li>
          </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="boxes">
        <h4>“Did you find the washing machine to be intuitive to use?"
          <ul>
            <li>Most users agreed that they understood everything about the washing machine except for how to set the
              time properly. </li>
          </ul>
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="boxes">
        <h4>“What was your reason for using the washing machine?”
          <ul>
            <li>Answers varied slightly here, but most people responded they were either out of clean clothes or that
              this is a weekly chore for them.</li>
